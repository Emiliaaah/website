In this post I'll be talking about my selfhosted services and my hardware.

# Hardware

My current setup consists of my Dell r710 which has:

- 2 x Intel Xeon X5650 @ 2.67GHz
- 144gb ddr3 ecc ram

This server has to be conencted to the internet somehow right?
Well thats why I have the following network setup:

- USG pro
- USW 24
- 2x Unifi AP AC Pro
- Some Poe netgear switch

And not the most interesting part
